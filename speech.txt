My dear countrymen, my family members!

Today is that auspicious moment when we pay our respects to the innumerable revered brave freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for the country and committed themselves for the freedom of the country; who struggled throughout their lives, embraced the gallows bravely with slogans of Bharat Mata ki Jai. It is a festival to remember their grit, resolve and patriotic virtues. It is due to these bravehearts that we have the good fortune of breathing freely on this festival of independence. The country is deeply indebted to them. We express our reverence towards every such great personality.

Dear Countrymen,

Today I extend my deep respect to all those who are protecting the country with full dedication with commitment for nation building; and are also trying to take the country to new heights. Be it our farmers, the high morale of the youth, the contributions of our mothers and sisters; or the dalits, oppressed, exploited, deprived; today their patriotic zeal and faith in democracy have become an inspiration for the world. I salute all such people with deep respect.

Dear Countrymen,

This year as well as for a few years in the past, natural disasters are becoming a huge cause of concern for us. Many people have lost their family and property, the nation has also incurred huge losses several times. Today I express my deepest condolences to all of them and assure that the nation stands with them in this hour of crisis.

Dear Countrymen,

Let us now recall the days of pre independence. During the hundreds of years of slavery, every period has been a struggle. Be it our youth, older people, farmers, women, or tribals, they have continuously fought against slavery. History is proof that even before the much-remembered Revolt of 1857, there were many tribal areas in our country where battles for independence were fought.

Friends,

Before independence, 40 crore countrymen showed immense spirit and capability. They marched forward with a dream, a resolution, and fought tirelessly. There was only one voice—”Vande Mataram,” and only one dream—Bharat’s freedom. We are proud that their blood runs in our veins today. They were our ancestors. They were just 40 crore. Just 40 crore people uprooted a global power and broke the shackles of slavery. If our ancestors, whose blood flows in our veins, could achieve this, then today we are a country of 140 crore people. If 40 crore people could break the shackles of slavery, if 40 crore people could fulfill the dream of achieving freedom, then 140 crore citizens of my country, 140 crore of my family members, if they set out with a resolution, determine a direction and march forward step by step, shoulder to shoulder, no matter how great the challenges, how intense the scarcity or the struggle for resources, we can overcome every challenge and build a prosperous Bharat. We can achieve the goal of a ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047. If 40 crore countrymen could give us freedom with their hard work, dedication, renunciation and sacrifice, then 140 crore countrymen can also build a prosperous Bharat with the same spirit.

Friends,

There was a time when people were committed to die for the country, and we achieved freedom. Today is the time to commit to living for the country. If the commitment to die for the country could bring us freedom, then the commitment to live for the country can also create a prosperous Bharat.

Friends,

Viksit Bharat 2047 is not just a phrase for speeches. There is hard work going behind it. Suggestions are being taken from many people across the country and we have sought suggestions from the citizens. I am pleased that crores of citizens have given countless suggestions for a Viksit Bharat 2047. Every citizen’s dream is reflected in this. Every citizen’s resolution is evident in this. Be it the youth, the elderly, villagers, farmers, dalits, tribals, people living in the mountains, forests or cities, everyone has given valuable suggestions to build a Viksit Bharat by 2047 when the country celebrates 100 years of its Independence.

I was immensely pleased to read these suggestions. What did they write? Some people proposed making Bharat the skill capital of the world. For a Viksit Bharat 2047, some suggested transforming the country into a global manufacturing hub. Some suggested that our universities should achieve global status. There were also those who questioned why our media shouldn’t be global after so many years of independence. Others expressed the belief that our skilled youth should become the first choice of the world. Some suggested that Bharat should become self-reliant in every aspect of life as soon as possible. Many advocated that the coarse grains produced by our farmers, which we call Shri Anna, these superfoods should reach every dining table across the globe. We must strengthen the nutrition of the world and also support the small farmers of India. Several people highlighted the need for governance reforms in various entities in the country, including local self-government institutions. Concerns about delays in the judicial system were also frequently expressed along with the need for judicial reforms. Many wrote that it’s the need of the hour to build many greenfield cities. One individual suggested launching a campaign for capacity building among the Government and administration in the face of increasing natural disasters. Others envisioned that Bharat’s own space station should be established as soon as possible. Some emphasized that Bharat should develop into a hub for traditional medicine and wellness as the world embraces holistic healthcare. Yet another remarked that there should be no delay in Bharat becoming the world’s third-largest economy.

Friends,

I was reading these suggestions because they have been provided by my fellow citizens. These are suggestions from the common citizens of my country. I believe that when the people of this nation possess such big thoughts and grand dreams, when their resolve is reflected in these words, it strengthens a new resolve within us. Our self-confidence reaches new heights, and this belief of people is not just an intellectual debate; it has emerged from experiences. This belief is the result of long-term hard work. Therefore, when the common man hears from the ramparts of the Red Fort that electricity will be provided to 18,000 villages in Bharat within a specific timeframe and that promise is fulfilled, their confidence is strengthened. When it is said that even after so many years of independence, there are still 2.5 crore families living in darkness without electricity, and when 2. 5 Crore homes receive electricity, then the confidence of the common man increases. When we talk about ‘Swachh Bharat’ clean Bharat, from affluent sections of society to rural families, people living in poor colonies or small children, every family today is embracing a clean environment and encouraging dialogue on cleanliness. Every citizen is behaving responsibly and checking on each other to ensure a social change towards clean habits and environment. I believe this is a true reflection of a new consciousness that has come within the country.

When it is announced from the ramparts of Red Fort that three crore families today receive clean drinking water from their taps, it is essential that all our families receive pure and clean drinking water. Through the Jal Jeevan Mission, 12 crore families are receiving hygienic tap water supply in a short duration. Today 15 crore families are the beneficiaries of this scheme. Who among our people were deprived of these facilities? Who was left behind? The forward strata of society did not face such lack of amenities. It is the dalits, the marginalized people, the exploited segment, the tribal brothers and sisters, people who dwell in slums and shackles, it is they who are devoid of such basic necessities. We made efforts to fulfill many such basic needs and the benefits of the results have been received by all members of the society.

We have given the mantra of Vocal for Local. Today I am happy that it has become a new mantra for economic development. Every district is now taking pride in their produce. One District One Product is the new wave now. Every district has now started thinking in the direction of exporting the product under One District One Product. The districts had taken the resolve of Renewable energy. India has achieved more in this sector than G 20 Nations collectively. India is working hard to become self-reliant in the energy sector and to resolve the challenges caused by Global warming.

Friends,

Our nation feels immensely proud of our success in Fintech which even the world wants to learn from us. This makes us feel even more proud of our abilities.

Friends,

How can we forget the crisis faced during the corona pandemic? It was in our own country that the fastest vaccination drive in the world was carried out. Now when our own army conducts surgical strikes and air strikes, the hearts of the youth are filled with pride and heads are held high. It is because of these that 140 crore countrymen today feel proud and confident.

Friends,

There has been a deliberate effort on all these aspects. The tradition of reform has been given further impetus. When political leadership is determined to bring empowerment and is resolute towards development then the government machinery also starts enabling and ensuring robust implementations. And when every citizen starts participating actively towards achieving these dreams then the desirable outcomes are bound to be achieved.

My dear countrymen,

Let us not forget that we as a nation have been facing tough situations even after several decades of freedom. This is because of our attitude of ‘chalta hai’ and accepting the status quo. We do not believe or participate in actuating the change. We do not challenge the status quo and do nothing new thinking that it will create more problems. There was an environment of status Quo, to make do with what is available, people believed that nothing is going to happen. We had to break this mentality; we had to fill ourselves with confidence, and we made efforts in that direction. Many people would say, “Why should we work for the next generation now? Let’s focus on the present.” But the ordinary citizens of the country did not want that; they were waiting for change, they desired change, they were eager for it. But no one gave importance to their dreams, hopes and aspirations. As a result, they continued to struggle through hardships. They waited for reforms. We were given the responsibility and we implemented significant reforms . Be it the poor, the middle class, the underprivileged , our growing urban population, the dreams and resolutions of the youth, their aspirations, we chose the path of reforms to bring about change in their lives. And I want to assure the citizens of the country that our commitment to reforms is not limited to the editorials of pink papers. Our commitment to reforms is not for a few days of applause. Our process of reforms is not driven by compulsion but by the intention to strengthen the nation. Therefore, today, I can say that our path of reforms has become a blueprint for growth. Our reforms, this growth, the change, these are not just topics for debate clubs, intellectual society or experts.

Friends,

We have not done this due to political compulsions. Whatever we do, we do not think by calculating political gains and losses. Our only resolution is—Nation First, Nation First, the nation’s interest is supreme. We take steps with the resolution that my India should become great.

Friends,

There is a long story when it comes to reforms and it might take hours If I go into its discussion. But I want to give a small example. The reforms in the banking sector—Think about the state of the banking sector—there was neither development, nor expansion, nor trust. Not only that, the kind of activities that were going on led our banks into crises. We implemented multiple reforms to strengthen the banking sector. And today, as a result, our banks have secured their place among the selected strong banks in the world. And when banks become strong, the power of the formal economy is also strengthened. When a banking system is established, it becomes the greatest strength to meet the needs of the common poor, especially middle-class families.

Whether it’s a home loan, a vehicle loan, a loan for my farmer to buy a tractor, a loan for my youth to start a start-up, a loan for education for the youth, or a loan to go abroad—these are all made possible through banks. I am happy that even my cattle rearers and my brothers and sisters involved in fisheries are benefiting from banks today. I am happy that millions of my street vendors are now connecting with banks, achieving new heights, and becoming partners in the path to development. Banks are the biggest support for our MSMEs and our small industries. They need money for daily expenses to progress further, and that has become possible today because of our strong banks.

Friends,

Although our country gained independence, a “Maai-Baap” culture took root unfortunately, where people were forced to constantly plead with the government, seek favors, and rely on references or recommendations. Today, we have transformed that model of governance. Now, it is the government that reaches out to the beneficiaries; it is the government that delivers gas stoves to their homes, brings water supply to their households, provides electricity, and offers financial assistance to encourage them to touch new heights of development. The government is actively taking steps to promote the skill development of our youngsters.

Friends,

Our government is deeply committed to major reforms, and through these efforts, we aim to set the country on a path of progress.

Friends,

New systems are being established in the country. To advance the nation, numerous financial policies are being continuously developed, and the country’s trust in these new systems is steadily growing. Those who are 20-25 years old today, and who were only 12-15 years old a decade ago, have witnessed this transformation taking place before their eyes. In just 10 years, their dreams have taken shape, sharpened, and ignited a new sense of self-confidence, which is now emerging as a formidable strength of the nation. Today, Bharat’s reputation has enhanced globally, and the world’s perception of Bharat has changed.

The doors of opportunities are now wide open for our youth around the world. Countless new employment opportunities, which had eluded us for so many years after independence, are now at their doorstep. Possibilities have expanded, and new opportunities are being created. The youth of my country no longer wish to move slowly. They do not believe in incremental progress. Instead, they are in the mood to take leaps, to achieve new milestones by making bold strides. I would like to say that this is a Golden Era for Bharat. Compared to global conditions also this is indeed our golden period.

My dear countrymen,

We must not let this opportunity slip away. If we seize this moment and move forward with our dreams and resolutions, we will fulfill the nation’s aspirations for a ‘Swarnim Bharat’ (Golden India) and achieve our goal of a developed Bharat by 2047. We have broken free from the shackles of centuries.

Today, whether it is the tourism sector, MSMEs, education, healthcare, transport, agriculture, or the farming sector, a new and modern system is being established in every field. We aim to advance in line with our country’s unique conditions while adopting the best practices from around the world. Every sector requires modernization and innovation, with an emphasis on integrating technology. Thanks to our new policies in every sector, these fields are gaining new support and strength. We must remove all obstacles, overcome any downturns, and move forward with full vigor, blossoming, achieving our dreams, and realizing success. We must internalize this vision and move decisively in that direction.

Now you can witness the massive change that is happening. I am throwing light on the changes happening at the grassroots through the women self-help groups. In the past decade, 10 crore sisters have become a part of these women self-help groups. 10 crore new sisters. I am feeling proud that 10 crore women from ordinary rural families are now becoming economically independent and self-reliant. When women become financially independent, they start contributing in important decision making in their families. They become guarantors and custodians of social transformation. I am equally proud of several CEOs from India who are playing compelling roles at the global level today. It is indeed fulfilling to see that while on the one hand our CEOs are dominating the global business landscape, on the other hand one crore mothers and sisters joined women self-help groups and are becoming ‘lakhpati didis’. This is a matter of immense pride for me as well. We have now decided to increase the fund allocated to women self-help groups from 10 lakhs to 20 lakhs. Until now, a total of nine lakh crore funds have been channeled via banks to these self-help groups which is enabling them to further their various works.

My friends,

My young minds kindly be mindful of the fact that the space sector is opening up new future for us. This is a very important aspect of development which we shall pay more emphasis on. We have introduced several new reforms in this sector. We have removed several restrictions that were gripping the growth of this sector. India is seeing a surge in startups in the space sector. This sector is now becoming very vibrant and is going to play a crucial role in making our country a powerful nation. We are futuristic in our vision while strengthening the sector. We feel proud that today private satellites and rockets are being launched in our own country. I can vouch for this fact that if policies are right, intentions are true with complete commitment towards national development then we are bound to achieve great outcomes.

My dear Countrymen,

Today our nation has opened up immense possibilities and new opportunities. We need to focus on two more advancements which have catapulted our economic growth and development. First is the development of modern infrastructure in which we have grown leaps and bounds. Second is Ease of Living. The common people should also have access to an affordable dignified lifestyle and basic amenities.

In the past decade we have witnessed humongous infrastructure development by providing state of art railways, airport, ports, robust roadways,broadband connectivity so that facilities reach the last mile such as ensuring every village and even forest zones get a school, modern hospitals and Arogya mandirs are built in faraway places to provide affordable healthcare to the marginalized through Ayushman Bharat schemes. Several medical colleges and hospitals are being built. Sixty thousand ponds ‘Amrit Sarovars’ have been revived and replenished. Optical fiber networks have already been installed in Two lakhs Panchayats. Many farmers are benefitting now due to the huge network of canals. Four crore pukka homes have given a new lease of life to the poor. Three crore new homes have been promised in an effort to further this national agenda.

Our North East India is now a hub for medical infrastructure and this transformation has helped us touch the lives by delivering accessible healthcare till the last mile. We have constructed roads connecting the remotest of villages and borders to bring these regions to the mainstream. Through these robust infrastructure networks, we have been able to fulfill the needs of the Dalits, exploited, deprived, backward, tribals, indigenous and inhabitants of forests, hills and far flung border areas. It has been a pivotal agenda while designing reforms to ensure holistic schemes for our citizens engaged in fisheries, animal husbandry.

Fulfilling the needs of our fisherfolk brothers and sisters, transforming the lives of our livestock keepers, striving for comprehensive development—this has been a part of our policies, our

intentions, our reforms, our programs, and our work style. And my young people get the greatest benefit due to these efforts. They get new opportunities, new possibilities arise for them to step into new areas, and this is what is providing the most employment, they have had the most opportunities to gain employment during this period.

Our middle-class families naturally have expectations of a quality life. They contribute significantly to the country, so it is the country’s responsibility to fulfill their expectations of quality life. We continuously strive to free them from bureaucratic hurdles. And I have envisioned that by 2047, when the dream of a Viksit Bharat will be realized, a component of this dream will be that there will be less government interference in the lives of ordinary citizens. We are committed to the kind of system where governance is not missing where it is necessary and where there is no impact due to delays caused by the government.

My dear fellow citizens,

We pay attention to even the smallest of needs. We focus on even the smallest necessities and work accordingly. Whether it is ensuring that the stove in our poor households keeps burning or ensuring that a poor mother does not have to go to sleep with worries in her mind, we are running a free healthcare plan. (Free) electricity, water, and gas (connections) are now in saturation mode, and when we talk about saturation, it means 100%. When saturation occurs, it does not carry the color of casteism and that of leftist ideology. When the mantra of saturation is embraced, the true essence of “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas” is realized.

We have taken steps to reduce government interference in people’s lives. The government used to burden ordinary citizens with thousands of compliances. We have eliminated over 1,500 laws so that citizens are not trapped in a web of legal complexities. There were laws created for small mistakes that could send people to jail. We have abolished the practice of imprisonment for minor offenses and removed provisions in the law that sent people to jail. Today, as we talk

about the legacy of taking pride in our freedom, we have replaced the centuries-old criminal laws with new criminal laws known as (Bharatiya) Nyaya Sanhita. At the core of this is not punishment but the idea of ensuring justice for citizens.

We are working on a nationwide mission to create Ease of Living. I emphasize this at every level of government. I urge all elected representatives, regardless of party or state, to take steps on a mission mode for Ease of Living. I request our youth, professionals, and everyone to keep writing to the government about the trivial issues they face with their solutions. They should inform the government. There is no harm in removing unnecessary difficulties. I firmly believe that today’s governments are sensitive. Whether it is local self-governance, state governments, or the central government, they will give importance to this issue.

Reforms in governance are essential for the dream of a Viksit Bharat by 2047. We must push forward with these reforms so that opportunities are created in the lives of ordinary citizens, and obstacles are eliminated. Citizens should experience dignity in their lives, and no one should ever have to say, “This was my right, and I did not get it.” People should not have to look for what they deserve. Therefore, the delivery system in governance needs to be strengthened further. Look at what happens when we talk about reforms in the country. Today, there are approximately 3 lakh institutions operating across the country. Whether it’s Panchayats, Nagar Panchayats, Nagar Palikas, Mahanagar Palikas, Union Territories, States, Districts, or the Centre, these 3 lakh small units are active. I appeal to these units today: If each of you undertake just two reforms per year at your level, reforms that directly benefit the common man, I am not asking for much, my friends. Whether it’s a Panchayat, a State Government, or any department, simply implement two reforms a year and put them into practice. Imagine the impact—this could result in around 25-30 lakh reforms annually. When 25-30 lakh reforms are made, the confidence of the common man will soar. This newfound confidence will be instrumental in elevating our nation to new heights. That is why we must step forward to initiate changes within our own spheres, break free from outdated systems, come forward to create the change, and act courageously. The needs of the common man are often small, but they can face challenges even at the Panchayat level. If we can address these issues, I am certain that we can realize our dreams.

My dear countrymen,

Today, our nation is brimming with aspirations. The youth of our country are eager to soar new heights and achieve greatness. Therefore, our aim is to accelerate progress in every sector, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, we must create new opportunities across all sectors. Secondly, we should work towards strengthening the supporting infrastructure required for evolving systems. And thirdly, we must prioritize and enhance the basic amenities for our citizens. These three aspects have fostered an aspirational society in Bharat, resulting in a society that is brimming with confidence. We are moving forward with immense passion by combining the aspirations of our citizens with the energy of our youth and the strength of our nation. I believe we have made significant strides in setting new records in employment and self-employment. Today, we have successfully doubled the per capita income. Bharat’s contribution to global growth is substantial, our exports are continuously rising, our foreign exchange reserves have doubled, and global institutions have increasingly placed their trust in Bharat. I believe that Bharat is on the right path, advancing at a fast pace, and that our dreams have great power. Alongside all this, our path of sensitivity energizes us and awakens a new consciousness. Compassion is central to our approach. And we are moving forward with both equality and compassion at the core of our work.

Friends,

When I think of the Corona period, if there is any country that has swiftly improved its economy amidst the global pandemic, it is Bharat. This reassures me that we are on the right path. When the Tricolour is proudly fluttered at every house, transcending caste and creed, it affirms that the country is moving in the right direction. Today, the entire nation is united under the Tricolour — every house is adorned with it, with no distinctions of caste, creed, higher-class, or lower-class; we are all Indians. This unity is a testament to the strength of our direction. When we lift 25 crore people out of poverty, it reinforces our belief that we have maintained our momentum, and our dreams will soon be fulfilled. When more than 100 aspiring districts are competing with the best districts in their respective states, we feel that both our direction and momentum of growth are certainly strong. Our tribal population is small but dispersed in really small groups across the country in remote locations and the government is concerned about their well-being and development. To ensure that the benefits of PM Jan Mann schemes reach each of them at various remote settlements in villages, hills and forests is a challenge for the government but we are not leaving any stone unturned. It gives fulfillment when you work compassionately. We should not only regard and respect women but we should make decisions with empathy for their wellness. In this earnest, we have extended paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for working women. We are responsible for the child in her lap who will become a good citizen only if the mother is taken care of. This motivates us to make compassionate decisions for the females of our country.

When my specially-abled brothers and sisters start communicating in the Indian sign language, or benefit from the campaign of inclusive and accessible nation through ‘Sugamya’ (accessible) Bharat, s/he feels respected and enjoys dignity as a citizen of the country. It is amazing to see our sportspersons come out in flying colors in paralympics. They draw strength from our compassion. We are making equitable decisions with high sensitivity towards our ostracized transgender society by bringing amendments and introducing new laws for their incursion into the mainstream and ensuring dignity, respect and equality for all. Thus, we are moving in the right direction of change. We have embarked onto the ‘Trividh Marg’ (three-way route) and are seeing a direct benefit of the spirit of service to all.

After 60 years, we have been chosen to serve the nation for the third consecutive time. In response to the blessings that 140 crore countrymen have given to me, I have only one message: We are here to serve each of you, every family and every region. With this power of your blessings, we aspire to achieve new heights of development. To pursue the dream of a developed India, from the ramparts of the Red Fort today, I bow my head in gratitude and thank the crores of countrymen for blessing us and choosing us to serve the nation. And I assure you all that we have to move forward to new heights, with a new zeal. We are not amongst those who watch from the sides and revel in the glory of small achievements. We are from a culture of seekers of new knowledge and resilience; the go-getters who relentlessly aspire for higher achievements. We want to scale newer heights of development and we wish to inculcate this habit among our citizens.

My dear countrymen,

Today, through the new education policy, we want to transform the current education system in line with the requirements of the 21st century. We have to prepare future ready skilled resources in India to meet the expectations of the fast paced development. The new education policy has a huge role to play in retaining new talent in India. I do not want the youth of my country to be forced to study abroad. A middle-class family spends lakhs and crores of rupees to send their children to study abroad. We want to develop an education system so that the youth of our country do not need to go abroad. Our middle-class families need not spend lakhs and crores of rupees. Not only that, we also want to create such institutions that attract people from abroad to come to Bharat instead. Recently, we have revived the pride of Bihar’s glorious history by reconstructing Nalanda University. Nalanda University has resumed its operations once again. However, we must once again, in the field of education revive that centuries-old Nalanda spirit, live that Nalanda spirit, and with great confidence, work towards bringing new consciousness to the world’s traditions of knowledge in the field of education. I firmly believe that the new education policy emphasizes the importance of the mother tongue. I urge the state governments and all institutions in the country that the country’s talent should not be hindered because of language. Language should not be a barrier. The strength of the mother tongue empowers even the poorest child in our country to fulfill their dreams. Therefore, we must emphasize the importance of studying in the mother tongue, the role of the mother tongue in life, and its place in the family.

My dear fellow citizens,

As we witness the changes in the world today, the importance of skills has greatly increased. Therefore, we want to give new impetus to skills. Keeping Industry 4.0 in mind, we aim for skill development. We also want skill development for capacity building in every sector of life, including in the agricultural sector. We want to focus on developing new skills even in our sanitation sector. Therefore, we have come out with the Skill India Programme on a much broader scale this time. We have earmarked a large fund in this year’s Budget for this purpose. In the Budget, we have also emphasized internships, so that our youth can gain experience, develop their capacity building and showcase their skills in the market. I want to prepare skilled youth in this manner. And friends, observing the global situation today, I can clearly see that Bharat’s skilled manpower, our skilful youth will be making their mark in the global job market, and we are moving forward with that dream.

Friends,

The world is changing rapidly and the importance of science and technology is increasing in every aspect of life. We need to place significant emphasis on science. I have noticed that there has been a new atmosphere of interest in science and technology in our schools and colleges after the success of Chandrayaan mission. This new enthusiasm must be nurtured by our educational institutions. The Government of India has also increased support for research. We have established more chairs. We have created the National Research Foundation providing it with a legal framework to develop a permanent system that continuously strengthens research. This research foundation will carry out that work. It is a matter of great pride that we have decided to allocate one lakh crore rupees for research and innovation in the Budget so that the ideas of our country’s youth can be realized.

Friends,

Even today, our children are going abroad for medical education. Most of them come from middle-class families, and they spend a huge amount of money. Over the last 10 years, we have increased the number of medical seats to nearly one lakh. Approximately 25,000 young people go abroad each year for medical education. Sometimes, I get surprised to hear about the countries they have to visit to pursue medical education. Therefore, we have decided that 75,000 new seats will be created in the medical field in the next five years.

My dear countrymen,

A Viksit Bharat of 2047 must also be a healthy Bharat. To ensure this, we must focus on the nutrition of children starting today as they are the first generation of a developed Bharat. That is why we have launched a nutrition campaign paying special attention to their well-being. We have initiated the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyaan), prioritizing nutrition.

My dear countrymen,

Transforming our agricultural system is crucial and the need of the hour. We must break free from the age-old traditions that have held us back for centuries, and we are actively supporting our farmers in this endeavor. We have been continuously working towards this transformation. Today, we provide farmers with easy access to loans and assist them with the latest technology. We are assisting the farmers to ensure value addition to their produce. We are also making comprehensive arrangements for marketing their produce so that the farmers have end to end assistance, and we are committed to moving forward in this direction.

Today, as the entire world is concerned about Mother Earth, we see the health of our soil deteriorating day by day due to the use of fertilizers. The productivity of our Mother Earth (soil) is also depleting and declining. At this critical time, I want to express my gratitude to the lakhs of farmers in our country who have chosen the path of organic farming and have taken on the responsibility of nurturing and protecting our Mother Earth. In this year’s budget, we have also made significant provisions and introduced substantial schemes to promote and support organic farming.

My dear countrymen,

When I observe the state of the world today, I see that the entire world is turning towards holistic healthcare where organic food has emerged as the preferred choice. If there is any nation that can create a global food basket of organic food, it is my country and its farmers. This is why we aspire to move forward with this vision in the coming days, so that our nation can become the organic food basket for the world as it increasingly demands organic food.

We are striving to ensure that the lives of farmers are made easier, villages have top-class internet connectivity, farmers have access to healthcare facilities and their children get access to smart schools as well as employment opportunities. Given the challenges of sustaining an entire family on small plots of land, we are making comprehensive efforts to equip the youth with the skills needed to secure new jobs and create additional sources of income.

In recent years, we have focused on a women-led development model. Be it innovation, employment or entrepreneurship, women are making significant strides in every sector. It’s not just about increasing participation, women are also taking on leadership roles. Today, in many areas—be it our defence sector, the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, or our space sector—we are witnessing the strength and capabilities of our women.

On the other hand, there are some pressing concerns which bring me a lot of trauma, hence, I once again wish to highlight them from the ramparts of the Red Fort. As a society we should seriously dwell upon the atrocities being meted out to our mother, sisters and daughters. The outrage is visible in the nation and among the citizens. I can feel this outrage. The states, society and the nation have to take serious cognizance of this malefaction. Crimes against women should be investigated without any delay. Those committing such demonic acts must be booked prima facie to reinstate the trust on the government, judiciary and civil society. I also want to mention that the rape victims – our mothers and daughters are highlighted all over the media and discussed in society, however the rapist does not make the news. Now the need of the hour is that there should be a wide discussion about the criminals who get punished so that even those who commit such sins fear the consequences including hanging to death. I feel that it is very important to create this fear.

My dear countrymen,

We have a habit of downsizing our own efforts and achievements as a nation. We unfortunately have stopped taking pride in our nationality for whatever reason. It was humiliating many times to hear ‘being late’ as a typical Indian mindset. We have worked hard to improve the perception of Indians at the global level. In the past even toys were imported in India. We have witnessed such days too. But today we are proud that our toy industry has also become a name to reckon with in the global market. We have started exporting toys. There was a time when mobile phones were being imported, but today India has a large hub of manufacturing ecosystem of mobile phones and we have started exporting them all over the world. Such is the prowess of India.

Friends,

Future of the world is connected with semiconductors, modern technology and AI. We have embarked on the semiconductor mission and aspire to have Made In India products which are available at competitive rates for the world. We have great talent pools and our youth should dream big in this sector. India has been into research and now we should move towards manufacturing as well. We have the capability and prowess to provide end to end solutions to the world in this sector.

Friends,

We have also seen the days when we had to struggle even for 2G. Today we can see the meteoric scaling up and Roll Out of 5G across the latitude and longitude of the country. Friends, we are not going to stop anywhere soon. We shall not agree to stop at 5G only. We are already working in the mission mode for 6G and we shall surprise the world with our progress. I can say this with full confidence.

My dear friends,

Talking about the Defence Sector, we were in the habit of questioning any increase in the Defence Budget. No one ever tried to know where the funds were utilized. The Defence Budget was spent on exports from other countries. I am deeply grateful to our Defence Forces as we see their promise in becoming self-reliant in this sector as well. They have shared a list of things that they have resolved not to export any more. We should learn true patriotism from our army. With this spirit we are becoming self-reliant in the defence sector. In the field of Defence Manufacturing India has also marked its presence. I am elated to say that our defence sector which was dependent on exporting even small items, has gradually emerged and is establishing itself as exporter and manufacturer of various Defence Equipment.

We want to promote the manufacturing sector because it is crucial for addressing unemployment. Today, the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme has been a great success. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) reforms have also given us significant strength. MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) have gained considerable momentum. A new system has been developed, and as a result, our manufacturing sector is on the path to becoming a global manufacturing hub. With a country that has such a large youth population and the capability to harness it, we aim to advance in the world of manufacturing with great strength, especially in Industry 4.0. We have also focused on the necessary skill development for this. We have introduced new models in skill development. We have encouraged public participation so that we can quickly develop skills according to immediate requirements. As I speak from the ramparts of the Red Fort, I am confident that the day is not far when Bharat will become an industrial manufacturing hub and the world will look up to it.

Today, many of the world’s leading companies want to invest in Bharat. I have observed this after the elections, and the majority of people requesting to meet with me in my third term are investors. These are global investors who want to come to Bharat and invest here. This is a

huge golden opportunity. I urge state governments to establish clear policies to attract investors. Provide assurance of good governance and build their confidence in the law and order situation. Every state should engage in healthy competition to attract investors. This competition will bring investment to their states, providing local youth with opportunities and creating jobs.

If policies need to be changed, states should adapt them according to global requirements. If land is required, states should create a land bank. The more proactive the states are in working towards good governance with a single-point focus and make efforts in this regard, the more likely it is that these investors will stay for the long term. This cannot be done by the central government alone; state governments play a crucial role because the projects will be implemented in the states. Daily interaction with state governments is essential for the projects to succeed. Therefore, I urge the states that as the world is increasingly attracted to Bharat and is committed to investing in Bharat, it is our responsibility to move forward with clear policies, leaving behind old habits. You will see the results in your state, and I assure you that your state will shine.

Friends,

It is important for Bharat to be recognized for its best quality. For the world, we now need to focus on the field of design and emphasize “Design in India.” We must strive to make Indian Standards synonymous with International Standards. When Indian Standards become International Standards, it will make it easier for our products to receive global acceptance. This will depend on the quality of our production, the quality of our services, and the quality of our approach. Therefore, we must focus on quality as we move forward. We have the talent. We can offer many new things to the world in the field of design. We must embrace the call of “Design in India” and move forward with the dream of “Design in India and Design for the World.”

I see a vast market emerging in the world of gaming. However, even today, the influence of gaming and the profits from creating these games are primarily held by foreign companies. Bharat has a rich heritage and we can bring new talent into the world of gaming. We can attract children worldwide to games made in our country. I want the children of Bharat, the youth of Bharat, Bharat’s IT professionals, and Bharat’s AI professionals to lead the world of gaming. In the gaming world, our products should make an impact globally. Our animators have the potential to work globally. We can establish a strong presence in the animation industry and should strive to work in that direction.

My dear countrymen,

Today, global warming and climate change are pressing issues and are being discussed across various sectors worldwide. Bharat has undertaken numerous initiatives in this regard. We have demonstrated our commitment through tangible actions, not mere words, and have achieved results that have astonished the world. We were pioneers in banning single-use plastics and have significantly advanced our renewable energy efforts, infusing new strength in this field. We are moving towards a net-zero future in the coming years and I remember the targets set in the Paris Accord. From the ramparts of the Red Fort, I wish to highlight the achievements of my countrymen. What the G-20 nations could not accomplish, our citizens have achieved. If any G-20 country has met its Paris Accord targets ahead of time, it is only my country, my Bharat. I take immense pride in this accomplishment. We have met our renewable energy targets and are ambitiously working towards reaching the target of 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030. It’s indeed a massive goal! The world may be astonished by this goal, but I confidently assure my fellow countrymen that we will achieve it. This will benefit humanity, secure our future, and ensure a bright future for our children. We are also committed to making our railways net-zero carbon emitter by 2030.

Friends,

The PM Surya Ghar Free Electricity Scheme is set to provide new strength, and its benefits will be felt by the average families in our country, particularly the middle class, when their electricity bills become free. The demand for electric vehicles is on the rise. Those who generate electricity from solar energy under the PM Surya Ghar Yojana, can also reduce their fuel costs.

Friends,

We aim to become a global hub through the Green Hydrogen Mission. Policies have been rapidly formulated, and their implementation is progressing swiftly. Bharat is committed to advancing green hydrogen as a new energy source. These efforts address concerns about climate change and global warming, while also opening up significant opportunities for green jobs. Thus, as the importance of green jobs expands in the near future, to seize this opportunity and provide employment for our youngsters, we must focus on promoting and expanding the green job sector.

My dear countrymen,

Today, under this tricolor flag, we are joined by the young athletes who have proudly represented Bharat on the global Olympic stage. On behalf of 140 crore fellow countrymen, I extend my congratulations to all the athletes and players of our nation. I also offer my best wishes with the hope that we will continue to strive towards new goals with renewed dreams, resolutions, and unwavering effort. In a few days, a large Indian delegation will depart for Paris for the Paralympics. I also convey my heartfelt best wishes to all our Paralympic athletes.

Friends,

India hosted the G-20, and it was organized across various cities in our country. More than 200 events were conducted! G-20 was never held in such a grand manner before, this was a first. This proves that Bharat has the capability to organize major international events and possesses unparalleled hospitality. With this established, our goal is clear: to host the 2036 Olympics on Indian soil. We are preparing for this and making significant progress towards it.

Friends,

It is our social responsibility to support the most disadvantaged members of society. If we leave anyone behind, it hampers our collective progress. Therefore, we can only truly advance if we uplift those who are lagging behind. It is our duty to make every effort to include the neglected regions, the marginalized communities, our small farmers, tribal brothers and sisters in the forests, our mothers and sisters, our laborers, and our workers, ensuring they are brought up to our level. The pace of this effort has already accelerated, and we will soon see these communities catch up with us, thereby strengthening our collective power. We must approach this task with great sensitivity and seize the significant opportunity that lies ahead.

What could be a more significant occasion for fostering sensitivity than this? Even before the 1857 freedom struggle, a tribal youth in our country stood firm against the British. At the age of 20-22, he challenged them fiercely, and today, he is revered as Bhagwan Birsa Munda. As we approach the 150th birth anniversary of Bhagwan Birsa Munda, let us draw inspiration from his legacy. Who could serve as a greater inspiration than Bhagwan Birsa Munda, exemplifying how even an individual of modest means can exhibit profound patriotism? As we celebrate Bhagwan Birsa Munda’s birth anniversary, let our sensitivity and compassion for society deepen. Let us commit to including every member of our community—the poor, the Dalits, the backward, the tribals—and advance together with this resolution.

My dear countrymen,

We are moving forward with determination and making significant progress. However, it is also true that there are some individuals who are unable to appreciate this progress. There are those who cannot think beyond their own welfare and do not care about the well-being of others. Such individuals, with their distorted mindset, are a concern. The country must avoid these people, who are mired in despair. When a handful of such individuals, consumed by their own negativity, spread this kind of toxicity, it leads to anarchy, destruction, chaos, and severe setbacks that necessitate immense efforts to rectify. These pessimistic elements are not merely hopeless; they are nurturing a negative mindset that dreams of destruction and seeks to undermine our collective progress. The country needs to recognize this threat. Nonetheless, I want to assure my fellow citizens that with our good intentions, integrity, and dedication to the nation, we will win over even those who oppose us. We will not waver from our commitment to advance our country, and I pledge to uphold this resolve.

Friends,

Challenges are abundant, both internal and external. As we grow stronger and gain more attention, these challenges are bound to increase. External challenges, in particular, are likely to escalate, and I am well aware of this. However, I want to convey to such forces that the development of Bharat does not mean a threat to anyone. Even in the past, when we were prosperous, we never dragged the world into wars. We are the land of Buddha, and war is not our path. Therefore, the world need not worry. As Bharat progresses, I urge the global community to understand Bharat’s values and its thousands of years of history. Do not perceive us as a threat. Do not resort to strategies that might make it harder for a land capable of contributing to the welfare of all humanity. But I also want to tell my fellow citizens that no matter how many challenges we face, confronting challenges is in Bharat’s nature. We will not waver, tire, stop, or bow down. We will leave no stone unturned in fulfilling our commitments, changing the destiny of 140 crore citizens, securing their future, and realizing the nation’s dreams. I assure you that we will triumph over every ill-intent with our good intentions.

My dear countrymen,

Changes in the social fabric can sometimes lead to significant challenges. Every citizen has been troubled by the termite of corruption. Corruption at all levels has shattered the common man’s faith in the system. The anger caused by the injustice to one’s abilities and potential harms the nation’s progress. That is why I have launched a widespread war against corruption. I know this battle comes at a price; it costs me my reputation. But no reputation can be more important than the nation, and no dream of mine can be bigger than the nation’s dreams. Hence, my fight against corruption will continue with complete sincerity and at a fast pace, and action will be taken against the corrupt. I want to create an environment of fear for the corrupt, so the tradition of looting the common citizen comes to an end. However, the biggest new challenge is not just dealing with the corrupt but also the high-level societal change that has emerged. This has become a significant challenge and a grave concern for society. We have a great Constitution. Can anyone imagine that some people in our own country are glorifying corruption? They are openly celebrating corruption. The attempt to sow such seeds in society, the glorification of corruption, and the continuous efforts to increase the acceptance of the corrupt have become a significant challenge for a healthy society and a matter of great concern. By distancing ourselves from corrupt individuals in society, we can create an environment where those who are corrupt will fear taking that path. However, if corruption is glorified, even those who are currently honest may begin to see it as a mark of prestige leading them to believe that engaging in such behavior is acceptable.

My dear countrymen,

I understand the concerns regarding recent events in Bangladesh, especially given our proximity as a neighboring country. I hope that the situation there soon returns to normalcy. The primary concern of our 140 crore citizens is to ensure the safety of Hindus, the minorities in Bangladesh. Bharat has always desired that our neighboring countries pursue a path of contentment and peace. Our commitment to peace is deeply rooted in our culture. In the days to come, our positive thoughts will continue to accompany Bangladesh on its development journey because we are the people dedicated to the welfare of humanity.

My dear countrymen,

As we mark the 75th anniversary of our Constitution, it is important to reflect on its pivotal role in uniting and strengthening our nation. Over these 75 years, the Constitution has been instrumental in fortifying Bharat’s democracy and safeguarding the rights of our dalits, the oppressed, the exploited and the deprived sections of the society. As we celebrate 75 years of the Indian Constitution, it is crucial for citizens to focus on the duties enshrined in the Constitution, and when I talk about duty, I do not just want to put a burden on the citizens. This responsibility extends beyond just the citizens to the Central Government, its employees, State Governments, State Government employees, and every local self-governing institution, whether it be a Panchayat, Municipalities, Municipal Corporations, Tehsil, or District. However, it is also essential that all 140 crore citizens recognise their duties. When we all fulfill our responsibilities collectively, we naturally become guardians of each other’s rights. By performing our duties, we inherently protect these rights without needing any additional effort. I hope we will embrace this mindset which will not only strengthen our democracy but also enhance our collective strength, propelling us forward with renewed power.

My dear countrymen,

In our country, the Supreme Court has repeatedly addressed the issue of the Uniform Civil Code. Numerous orders have been issued, reflecting the belief of a significant portion of our population—and rightly so—that the current Civil Code resembles a Communal Civil Code, one that is discriminatory. As we celebrate 75 years of the Constitution, we must hold extensive discussions on this subject as the Supreme Court advocates for this change. And it is our collective responsibility to realize the vision of the framers of our Constitution. We should welcome diverse opinions and perspectives. Laws that divide our nation based on religion and foster discrimination have no place in modern society. Therefore, I assert that it is time for the country to demand a Secular Civil Code. After 75 years of a Communal Civil Code, it is crucial to move towards a Secular Civil Code. Once this shift takes place, it will eliminate religious discrimination and will bridge the gap felt by ordinary citizens.

My dear countrymen,

When I always talk about the concern of dynastic politics and casteism in the country, I believe they are causing significant harm to the democracy of Bharat. We need to free the country and politics from dynastic politics and casteism. Today, I see that the young people in front of me are associated with the “MY Bharat” organization. It is written very well. “MY Bharat” has several missions. One of the missions is to bring one lakh young people into political life as representatives as soon as possible. Initially, we want to bring forward one lakh young people whose families have no political background—those whose parents, siblings, uncles, aunts have never been involved in politics, in any generation. We want fresh blood, one lakh such talented young people, whether they come into the panchayat, municipal corporations, district councils, state assemblies, or the Lok Sabha. We want new young people with no previous political history in their families to enter politics so that we can be freed from casteism and dynastic politics thereby enriching democracy. It is not necessary that they join a particular party; they should join whichever party they prefer and become representatives. The country should decide that if one lakh such young people whose families are far removed from politics enter the system in the near future, it will lead to new thinking and new capabilities while also enriching democracy. Therefore, we need to move in this direction. I would also like to say that frequent elections are becoming a hindrance to the country’s progress, creating obstacles. Today, it has become easy to link any scheme with elections, because elections are happening somewhere in the country every three or six months. Whenever you announce any scheme, you see in the media that it is linked to elections. Every scheme is coloured by the hue of elections. Hence, there has been extensive discussion in the country. All political parties have expressed their views. A committee has prepared a very good report. The country needs to come forward to embrace the concept of “One Nation One Election”. From the ramparts of the Red Fort with the Tricolor as witness, I urge the political parties and those who understand the Constitution of the country, to come forward to make the dream of “One Nation One Election” a reality for the progress of Bharat and the maximum utilization of its resources for the common people.

My dear countrymen,

This is the golden period of Bharat. Viksit Bharat 2047 awaits us. This country is committed to moving forward with a firm resolution by overcoming obstacles, hurdles and challenges. And friends, I see clearly, there is no hesitation in my thoughts. There is no veil in front of my dreams. I can see clearly that the blood of our ancestors is in the veins of the 140 crore people. If those 40 crore people could fulfill the dreams of independence, then 140 crore citizens can realize the dream of a prosperous Bharat. 140 crore citizens can realize the dream of a Viksit Bharat. As I have said before, the country is bound to become the third-largest economy during my third term, and that I will work three times harder, at three times the speed and with three times the scale so that the dreams we have for the nation are realized sooner. Every moment of mine is for the nation; every second is dedicated to the country; every bit of my being is solely for Maa Bharati. Therefore, with the commitment of working 24×7 and with the vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047, I call upon my fellow citizens: Let us make the dreams of our forefathers a resolution, connect our dreams to them and add our efforts to them. Let us align our aspirations and our efforts to ensure that the 21st century, which is destined to be the century of Bharat, becomes a ‘Swarnim Bharat’ (Golden India), and make ‘Viksit Bharat’ in this century and advance towards fulfilling those dreams. As an independent Bharat is reaching new milestones after 75 years of its journey, let us not leave any stone unturned. And I assure you that I will leave no stone unturned in the wake of the responsibility you have entrusted in me. I will never shy away from hard work. I never back down in courage; I never fear facing challenges. Why? Because I live for you, I live for your future, I live for the bright future of Mother India. Let us move forward with firm resolve under the shadow of the national flag, under the shadow of the Tricolour, to realize those dreams. Speak with me
